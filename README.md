# ara-oasis-api 
This is the documentation repository for the Applied Research Associates, Inc. Oasis LMF REST API &amp; Compute process documentation.  This API and parallel compute process are used to supply the Oasis LMF with data to run the ARA, Inc. hurricane  model.  

The [WIKI](https://github.com/ara-risk/ara-oasis-api/wiki) here will be of most interest to those running and/or supporting the ARA, Inc. hurricane loss model on the Oasis platform and is [available here](https://github.com/ara-risk/ara-oasis-api/wiki). 

Support requests may be submitted through this repositories [issues](https://github.com/ara-risk/ara-oasis-api/issues).
